This is my poker bot app. Designed for use while playing standard Texas Hold'em, the app uses 2 modes: calculator mode and bot mode. Caclulator mode gives the user the statistics on getting a specific hand at any point in the round, while Bot mode gives the user a recommended move (flop, bet, raise, etc) based on a hardcoded threshold + a little bit of randomness. Work in progress at the moment redesigning the statistics portion of the code.
